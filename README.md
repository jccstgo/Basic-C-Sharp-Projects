# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
This Repository have projects in C# and reflects what I learned in my C# course, in which I addressed the following projects:

 - [Lambda Functions](https://github.com/jccstgo/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Lambda)
 - [NewlestterApp MVC](https://github.com/jccstgo/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/NewlestterAppMVC)
 - [TwentyOne Game](https://github.com/jccstgo/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne) (Try betting a little!)
 - [Date Time](https://github.com/jccstgo/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/DateTime) 
 - [Method to convert from decimal number to binary, octal and hexadecimal](https://github.com/jccstgo/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Methods) ==> A beautiful calculator =)
